`Hishel` provides the `Controllers`, which allow you to fully customize how the cache works at the specification level.

You can choose which parts of [RFC 9111](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html) to ignore. For example, this is useful when you want to ensure that your client does **not use stale responses** even if they are **acceptable from the server.**

### Cachable HTTP methods

You can specify which HTTP methods `Hishel` should cache.

Example:

```python
import hishel

controller = hishel.Controller(cacheable_methods=["GET", "PUT"])
client = hishel.CacheClient(controller=controller)
```

!!! note
    `Hishel` will only cache `GET` methods if the cachable methods are not explicitly specified.

### Cachable status codes

If you only want to cache specific status codes, do so.

Example:

```python
import hishel

controller = hishel.Controller(cacheable_status_codes=[301, 308])
client = hishel.CacheClient(controller=controller)
```

!!! note
    If the cachable status codes are not explicitly specified, `Hishel` will only cache status codes **200, 301, and 308**.


### Allowing heuristics

You can enable heuristics calculations, which are disabled by default.

Example:

```python
import hishel

controller = hishel.Controller(allow_heuristics=True)
client = hishel.CacheClient(controller=controller)

```

!!! tip
    If you're not familiar with `Heuristics Caching`, you can [read about it in the specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html#name-calculating-heuristic-fresh).

### Allowing stale responses

Some servers allow the use of stale responses if they cannot be re-validated or the client is disconnected from the server. Clients MAY use stale responses in such cases, but this behavior is disabled by default in `Hishel`.

Example:

```python
import hishel

controller = hishel.Controller(allow_stale=True)
client = hishel.CacheClient(controller=controller)
```

!!! tip
    `Hishel` will attempt to use stale response only if the client is unable to connect to the server to make a request. You can enable stale responses to receive responses even if your internet connection is lost.

### Specifying revalidation behavior

Responses are revalidated by default when they become stale; however, you can always revalidate the responses if you wish.

Example:

```python
import hishel

controller = hishel.Controller(always_revalidate=True)
client = hishel.CacheClient(controller=controller)
```

!!! note
    Because we already have the response body in our cache, revalidation is very quick.
